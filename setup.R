                                                        In order for that CHEM to be readily transferable to multiple jurisdictions, we aim for it to meet six explicit transparency, reusability and updatability (TRU) criteria.
                                                        These criteria are: (T1) open access software files; (T2) easily identifiable developer contributions and judgments; (R1) programming practices promote selective reuse; (R2) permissions for derivative works; (U1) maintenance infrastructure; and (U2) systematic retesting and deprecation.
                                                        To overcome technical challenges to achieving this goal, we developed a prototype software framework.
                                                        We specified framework user requirements for a template CHEM module, a simple programming syntax and tools for authoring new CHEM modules, supplying CHEMs with data, reporting reproducible analyses, searching for CHEM modules and maintaining a project website.
                                                        We developed the framework as six development version code libraries in the open-source programming language R that integrate with online services for software development and research data archiving. 
                                                        We used the framework to author five development version R libraries of utility mapping CHEM modules in youth mental health that provide tools for variable validation, dataset description, multi-attribute instrument scoring, construction of mapping models, reporting of mapping studies and making out of sample predictions.
                                                        We assessed these utility mapping modules as meeting TRU criteria T1, R1-2 and U1. The remaining two TRU criteria are partially met, but require more detailed documentation (for T2) and more unit testing (for U2).
                                                        Our software framework has potential value as a prototype for future tools to support the development of transferable CHEMs.",
