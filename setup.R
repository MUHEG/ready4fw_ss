                                                        The prototype software framework integrates with services for software development and research data archiving. 
                                                        We used the framework to developed an initial set of utility mapping CHEMs in youth mental health that can be assessed as meeting explicit TRU criteria.
                                                        Our software framework has potential value as a prototype for future tools to support ethical implementation of CHEMs.",
