In this paper, we:

(i)	describe a prototype software framework we have developed to support the ethical implementation of CHEMs; and
<!-- propose a set of ethical responsibilities for CHEM project teams and criteria for assessing ethical CHEM implementations; -->

<!-- (ii)  -->

(iii)	assess an initial set of youth mental health CHEMs developed with our software framework against our proposed ethical CHEM implementation criteria.
