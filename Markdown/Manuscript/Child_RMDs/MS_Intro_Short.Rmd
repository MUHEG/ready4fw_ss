<!-- Health economics is a discipline concerned with problems that arise due to scarce resources, such as how to value health and healthcare, allocate healthcare budgets and configure health services [@wagstaff2012four]. In seeking to solve these problems, health economists typically use models which are simplified and selective representations of systems that are believed to influence human health. A health economic model should be capable of being described using words and figures (a conceptual model), equations (a mathematical model) and software (a computational model).  Health economic scientific manuscripts typically describe a model using its conceptual and mathematical representations but report results that have been generated by its computational representation (i.e., the format that allows computers to perform calculations). The conceptual, mathematical and computational representations of a model are assumed to be isomorphic. However, the ease of independently assessing the validity of this assumption depends in part on how a health economic model has been implemented computationally. -->

<!-- The set of software files implementing a health economic model's structure, data and algorithms can be called a computational health economic model (CHEM). CHEMs can be developed using commercial modelling software or open-source programming languages such as Python [@python2009] or R [@RCORE2022]. An advantage of commercial modelling software is that users often require limited or no programming skills to develop and apply CHEMs. However, open-source software programming languages may facilitate the development of CHEMs that are more transparent, reusable and updatable [@incerti2019r; @Pouwels2022]. The decision about what type of software development platform to use must balance ethical considerations and resource constraints (see Table \@ref(tab:proscons)).  -->

<!-- Import_start -->Computational models, particularly those addressing economic topics, have become essential tools for health policy development [@dakin2015influence; @Erdemir2020]. Although influential and widely used, health economic models can be skills and resource intensive to develop.<!-- Import_end --> One suggestion for making health economic modelling projects more tractable is for health economists to re-use each other's models [@Arnold2010]. 

<!-- Imported_from_Ethics-->Key concerns for health economists when considering whether to reuse a model are generalisability (application without adaptation) and transferability (application of selected components and/or application with modification) [@RN39]. Health economic models are likely to require at least some modification before they can be validly applied to a new jurisdiction, time period or decision problem. Making such modifications is harder if the software files that implement the model - the Computational Health Economic Model (CHEM) â€“ cannot be readily understand, used and edited.

<!-- End_Imported_from_Ethics -->
<!-- A potential strategy for implementing transferable CHEMs is to adopt an open-source and modular approach to model development. Open source projects grant third parties liberal permissions to access, use and modify model source code and data.  Potential benefits of open-source CHEMs that have been identified by health economists include improving model transparency, promoting model reuse, making model development more efficient and gaining the confidence of model users [@Pouwels2022]. A number of complex open source computational modelling projects in disciplines such as biology [@pan2021modular], ecology [@barros2023empowering] and neuroscience [@frazier2022robust] have also been implemented as modular models. A modular model is constructed from multiple reusable and replaceable sub-models (modules) [@pan2021modular]. Modules can share inputs and outputs with other modules or can be run as independent models [@barros2023empowering]. Advantages of modular models include feasibility (large projects are broken into smaller tasks, with each component independently developed and tested) and flexibility (making it easier to selectively replace or update specific parts of a model and to scale up or down the level of granularity) [@pan2021modular].  -->

<!-- Modular CHEMs provide an opportunity for multiple modelling teams to contribute to, test and reuse models.  -->

<!-- Actual implementations of open-source CHEMs are relatively rare [@Emerson2019; @Michalczyk2018; @Feenstra2022]. Recent efforts to build this field including an initiative to develop a suite of open source CHEMs addressing different health conditions in the United States [@Jansen2019] and a Canadian platform facilitating access to and validation of multiple CHEMs [@harvard2022developing]. Modular health economic models are also rare, though examples exist in infectious disease [@Trauer2017] and cardiology [@Urach2013]. Barriers to greater use of open-source approaches include health economist concerns about intellectual property, confidentiality, model misuse and the resources required to maintain open source implementations [@Pouwels2022; @Wu2019].  -->
<!--Benefits --><!-- Adherence to good practice guidance is an essential requirement for healthcare modelling [@Erdemir2020], but  --><!-- Guidelines for implementing open source CHEMs remain scarce, piecemeal and need improving [@Sampson2019].  -->
<!-- When health economic models are owned by pharmaceutical companies and consultancies, commercial considerations may also limit the reuse of models and their constituent code and data [@Feenstra2022]. Health economists have also identified issues relating to model generalisability and transferability and the software platforms in which CHEMs are authored as important barriers to open-source CHEMs [@Pouwels2022]. We are not aware of published literature identifying barriers to modular CHEMs, but potentially these may relate to the limited benefit of undertaking modular approaches in projects that are not also open-source. -->
<!-- Move to discussion--><!-- In health economics the related and enabling concept of reference models has been recommended [@Afzali2013].  -->
<!-- Transferring a health economic model developed for one jurisdiction for application in another typically involves retaining some features and updating others [@barbieri2010international]. However, models do not always make implementation choices (for example, use of concepts with standardised meanings across jurisdictions)<!-- [@garcia2021cost] -->  <!-- facilitate such selective re-use. -->
<!-- Open-source CHEMs remain rare [@Feenstra2022; @Emerson2019]. The software used to develop CHEMs was identified as a barrier to open-source model implementations by participants in a 2020 survey of health economists [@Pouwels2022]. Other reported barriers relate to difficulties in generalising models, updating models and transferring model data, concerns about the level of public access and lack of interest from decision-makers, and legal, confidentiality and security considerations [@Pouwels2022].  -->
<!-- typically have a number of limitations that at best restrict their usefulness and which in some cases may facilitate harmful misuse. -->

Some of the barriers<!-- Give examples --> to the development of transferable CHEMs <!-- that use open-source and modular approaches  -->could be addressed by appropriate software frameworks.<!-- Check last sentence was not used in ethics manuscript  --> A software framework is a shared common technology used by developers to collaboratively author software <!-- and which is not typically visible to software end-users  -->[@myllarniemi2018development]. A software framework provides a foundation for developing multiple software applications with shared resources (e.g., code and data files), that can be modified to suit specific needs. Advantages of using software frameworks include facilitating code reuse and extension, promoting good programming practice and the capability to provide enhanced functionality and performance without additional effort by developers [@edwin2014software]. <!-- Software frameworks have widely been developed and implemented in data science, for example, PyTorch [@PyTorch2019] for machine learning using Python. However, software frameworks can be challenging and time consuming to create and may become excessively complex over time [@edwin2014software]. Software frameworks can also be difficult to learn, often requiring model developers to undergo specialist training [@myllarniemi2018development]. -->

<!-- There are multiple challenges to overcome when developing a software framework.

<!-- A high-level software framework for implementing open-source <!-- Modification_start --><!--  CHEMsin R has previously been developed with the primary aim of improving model transparency [@alarid2019need].  -->


<!-- However, to gain widespread adoption, a software framework for CHEMs may need to provide tools to help model developers meet a broader range of ethical practice requirements.  -->
