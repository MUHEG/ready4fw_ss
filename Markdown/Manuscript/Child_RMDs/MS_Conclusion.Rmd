<!-- We have identified criteria that can be used to systematically assess the extent to which the computational implementation of health economic models adheres to transparency, reusability and updatability criteria.  -->
Our software framework provides the outline of a technical solution to some of the challenges of transferable CHEM development using open-source and modular approaches. Our framework can be used as a prototype for developing future software frameworks to support implementation of transferable CHEMs. 
<!-- Barriers to ethical CHEM practice arising from resource constraints should be addressed by research funders. -->
