<!-- We have identified criteria that can be used to systematically assess the extent to which the computational implementation of health economic models adheres to transparency, reusability and updatability criteria.  -->
We have developed a prototype software framework that can support the implementation of CHEMs that largely meet explicit criteria for CHEM transparency, reusability and updataility. Our framework can be used as a prototype for developing future software frameworks to support ethical implementation of CHEMs. Barriers to ethical CHEM practice arising from resource constraints should be addressed by research funders.
