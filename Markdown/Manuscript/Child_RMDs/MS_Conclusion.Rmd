We have identified criteria that can be used to systematically assess the extent to which the computational implementation of health economic models adheres to transparency, reusability and updatability criteria. We have developed a prototype software framework that can support the implementation of CHEMs that largely meet these criteria. Our framework can be used as a prototype for developing future software frameworks to support ethical implementation of CHEMs.
