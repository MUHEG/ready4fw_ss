<!-- We have identified criteria that can be used to systematically assess the extent to which the computational implementation of health economic models adheres to transparency, reusability and updatability criteria.  -->
Our software framework provides a solution to some technical barriers we faced when seeking to implement a transferable CHEM in youth mental health. Our framework can be used as a prototype for developing future software frameworks that address the user-requirements of the broader health economic modelling community. 
<!-- Barriers to ethical CHEM practice arising from resource constraints should be addressed by research funders. -->
