\\textbf{Summary: }
To facilitate Computational Health Economic Models (CHEMs) that are Transparent, Reusable and Updatable (TRU), we have developed a prototype software framework in the open-source programming language R.
                                                        The framework comprises six code libraries for authoring CHEMs, supplying CHEMs with data and undertaking analyses with CHEMs. 
                                                        The prototype software framework integrates with services for software development and research data archiving. 
                                                        We used the framework to developed an initial set of utility mapping CHEMs in youth mental health that can be assessed as meeting explicit TRU criteria.
                                                        Our software framework has potential value as a prototype for future tools to support ethical implementation of CHEMs.
