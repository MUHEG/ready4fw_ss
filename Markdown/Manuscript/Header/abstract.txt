\\textbf{Summary: }
We are developing an open source and modular Computational Health Economic Model (CHEM) in youth mental health.
                                                        In order for that CHEM to be readily transferable to multiple jurisdictions, we aim for it to meet six explicit transparency, reusability and updatability (TRU) criteria.
                                                        These criteria are: (T1) open access software files; (T2) easily identifiable developer contributions and judgments; (R1) programming practices promote selective reuse; (R2) permissions for derivative works; (U1) maintenance infrastructure; and (U2) systematic retesting and deprecation.
                                                        To overcome technical challenges to achieving this goal, we developed a prototype software framework.
                                                        We specified framework user requirements for a template CHEM module, a simple programming syntax and tools for authoring new CHEM modules, supplying CHEMs with data, reporting reproducible analyses, searching for CHEM modules and maintaining a project website.
                                                        We developed the framework as six development version code libraries in the open-source programming language R that integrate with online services for software development and research data archiving. 
                                                        We used the framework to author five development version R libraries of utility mapping CHEM modules in youth mental health that provide tools for variable validation, dataset description, multi-attribute instrument scoring, construction of mapping models, reporting of mapping studies and making out of sample predictions.
                                                        We assessed these utility mapping modules as meeting TRU criteria T1, R1-2 and U1. The remaining two TRU criteria are partially met, but require more detailed documentation (for T2) and more unit testing (for U2).
                                                        Our software framework has potential value as a prototype for future tools to support the development of transferable CHEMs.
